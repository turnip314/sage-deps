# Sage Deps - A Sage Dependency Analysis Tool

This is a ![SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) dependency analysis tool used for understanding Sage's structure. It can be used to detect circular imports, upstream dependencies, and provide various dependency-graph metrics including PageRank.

**Warning:** This package is still in its testing phase, and may have unexpected behaviour.

# Installation

## Dependencies
The package requires ![numpy](https://numpy.org/), ![scipy](https://scipy.org/), ![networkx](https://networkx.org/), and ![scikit-network](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-network/).

## Install from PyPi:
Run `pip install sage-deps` to install as a pypi package. Make sure the script `sdeps.exe` is added to PATH to run the `sdeps` command.

## Manual Install
To install, simply download or clone the repository. Navigate to the root folder (where `pyproject.toml` lives) and run `pip install .`.

## Additional Setup

The package requires access to the ![SageMath repository](https://github.com/sagemath/sage). By default, it assumes you have the repository cloned to the same parent directory as your sage-deps folder. You may modify this by modifying the environment variable `SAGEBASE` in `sagedeps/python/constants.py`, or specifying the Sage installation directory using options (see below).


## Getting started

To ensure the package is successfully installed, run `sdeps`. It should output a blank line by default. 

The package comes with some pre-compiled resource files generated by SageMath version 10.6. To update these pre-generated files, run
```
sdeps 
```

                [-view [SHOW_VIEW]] [--verbose]

A program top help manage SageMath dependencies.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s, --sage-source SAGE_SOURCE
                        The source file of Sage.
  -m, --modules-source MODULES_SOURCE
                        Specify the modules file.
  -o, --output-file OUTPUT_FILE
                        Specify the file to dump the output.
  -up UP_DEPENDENCY UP_DEPENDENCY
                        Generates a breadth-first dependency tree rooted at a particular node, up to a given depth.
  -cc CHECK_CYCLES CHECK_CYCLES
                        Finds cycles starting at given node.
  -gm, --generate-modules
                        Generate a modules file. Can optionally pass in destination file.
